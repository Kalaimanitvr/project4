## 📜 Project Introduction
Bird strikes are a significant safety and financial concern in the aviation industry, leading to operational disruptions and substantial costs. This project leverages **data analysis and visualization** to:
- Identify patterns in bird strike incidents.
- Analyze high-risk locations, time periods, and environmental factors.
- Recommend mitigation strategies to reduce operational and financial impacts.

The dataset includes:
- **Incident details**: Location, time, and weather conditions during bird strikes.
- **Wildlife types**: Size and species of birds involved.
- **Operational impact**: Costs associated with damages, delays, and emergency landings.

As a **data analyst**, this project aims to:
- Provide actionable insights for airport and airline stakeholders.
- Enhance safety protocols and wildlife management strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
### Key Goals
1. **Identify Risk Patterns**:
   - Understand the frequency and distribution of bird strikes by location, time, and weather conditions.
   - Analyze wildlife species and their behavior in relation to aviation incidents.

2. **Quantify Operational Impact**:
   - Assess the financial costs of bird strikes, including damages and operational disruptions.
   - Highlight high-risk flight phases and their associated risks.

3. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Propose actionable measures, such as habitat management, bird deterrents, and enhanced weather monitoring.

## 🛠️ Methodology
### Data Analysis Process
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed bird strike trends over time and by geographic region.
   - Assessed the relationship between weather conditions and bird strike frequency.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created interactive dashboards in Tableau to showcase key insights:
     - **State-level trends**: California, Texas, and Florida lead in bird strike incidents.
     - **Seasonality**: Incidents peak from **July to September**, with September being the highest-risk month.
     - **Weather conditions**: Most strikes occur under clear or partially cloudy skies.

3. **Operational Impact Assessment**:
   - Quantified the costs of precautionary landings, engine shutdowns, and other disruptions.
   - Highlighted Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport as the highest-risk airport.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Identified high-risk bird species, such as small and medium-sized unknown birds, often involved in strikes during the approach and climb phases of flight.

## 📈 Key Insights and Findings
### 🔍 Bird Strike Patterns
- **Seasonality**:
  - Bird strikes peak during late summer (July-September), with the highest count in September.
- **Weather Influence**:
  - 49% of strikes occur under clear skies, while 34% happen in partially cloudy conditions.
- **Geographic Trends**:
  - California, Texas, and Florida report the most incidents, with California leading at 2,969 strikes.

### 💰 Financial and Operational Impact
- **Cost Breakdown**:
  - **Precautionary Landings**: $82M.
  - **Engine Shutdowns**: $22M.
  - Total estimated cost of wildlife strikes: $140M.
- **Incident Severity**:
  - Precautionary landings are the most frequent and costly incidents, emphasizing the need for enhanced pilot training and pre-flight checks.

### 🛫 Flight Phases and Wildlife Risks
- **Phases Most Affected**:
  - Approach and climb phases experience the highest frequency of bird strikes.
- **Wildlife Involved**:
  - Unknown small and medium birds are the most common, highlighting the importance of species-specific management.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project underscores the critical need for **data-driven wildlife management** in aviation to reduce bird strikes and their associated impacts.

### Key Takeaways:
- **High-Risk Locations and Times**:
  - Airports in California, Texas, and Florida, particularly during late summer, require targeted mitigation strategies.
- **Operational Challenges**:
  - Clear weather increases bird activity, necessitating improved monitoring and alert systems.
- **Safety and Cost Mitigation**:
  - Emergency landings and engine shutdowns account for significant costs and risks, highlighting the need for preemptive measures.

### Business Impact:
Stakeholders in the aviation industry can leverage these insights to:
1. Implement **habitat management** techniques to reduce bird presence near airports.
2. Enhance **pilot awareness** through real-time weather updates and bird activity monitoring.
3. Optimize **wildlife control budgets** by prioritizing high-risk locations and times.
